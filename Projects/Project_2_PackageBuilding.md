# Build your own package

In this exercise, you will use what you learned today to create your own package. We
expect that the package will be cleanly written code, well-documented (with a
readthedocs page), and downloadable via pip.

Your package should implement (at least) one statistical method. You are welcome to
choose from the list we've provided below, or, if there's something that you're
particularly excited about, then you can choose your own methods. We'd prefer if there
was not complete overlap in the methods implemented across groups.

1. Instrumental Variables (IV)
2. Fixed effects/random effects
3. Zero-inflated regression
4. Multinomial logit
5. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
6. Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH)
7. Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH)
8. Kalman filter or other filters
